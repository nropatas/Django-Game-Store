* `721130` Ekaterina Shmeleva
* `528621` Felipe Gonzalez Carceller


### 2. Goal

The goal is to develop an online game store where *(1)* developers can publish and sell games and view statistics for games and *(2)* players can search for games, purchase games via an online payment system, launch and play games, leave public comments for developers and other players, and view leaderboards for individual games.

### 3. Plans

#### 3.1 Basic Features

**Authentication**
* User registration and logging in and out will be implemented using the [Django authentication system](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/topics/auth/);
* User registration with email verification will be implemented by configuring our Django web application to use the [console backend](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/topics/email/#console-backend) for sending emails.

**Player Functionalities**
* Search games and filter games by genre, price, and ownership;
* Purchase games via an online payment system;
* Launch and play games;
* View leaderboards for individual games;
* Leave public Facebook comments and share games on social media (*see 3.2*).

**Developer Functionalities**
* Publish and manage games, including setting and making changes to its URL, description, and price;
* View sales statistics.

**Game Interactions**
* Recording player high-scores.

**Security**
* Players should only be able to play games they have purchased;
* Developers should only be able to modify and access statistics of their own games and should not be able to impersonate other developers;
* Developers should not be able to play games, players should not be able to publish games;
* Etc.

#### 3.2 Extra Features

**Social Login**
* We will implement Facebook Login to provide an alternative to the standard email registration using either [`django-allauth`](https://github.com/pennersr/django-allauth) or [`django-facebook`](https://github.com/tschellenbach/Django-facebook) library.

**RESTful API**
* We will implement an API for retrieving publicly available information:
  * A `GET` method for searching games with pagination;
  * A `GET` method for retrieving high scores for individual games.

**Social Media Sharing**
* We will add [Facebook](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/share-button/) and [Twitter](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-for-websites/tweet-button/overview.html) share buttons so that users can share a game (including its image, description, and URL) and their high scores.

**Mobile Friendly**
* We will build our application using [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/) to support a variety of devices, including smartphones, tablets, and desktops.

**Facebook Comments**
* We will use the [Facebook Comments Plugin](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/comments/) to let players comment on games.

### 4. Process and Time Schedule

We will mostly communicate using [Telegram](https://telegram.org/) and, additionally, we will meet in person for a discussion at least once week or more often, if required.

We will first start working on mandatory features. At each stage, we will divide tasks among team members, so that everyone knows what they should work on next. [Trello](https://trello.com) will be used to create, define, assign, and track tasks.

* Week 1: Set up a database and build a simple layout.
* Week 2: Implement authentication.
* Weeks 3-4: Basic player and developer functionalities and CSS.
* Week 5: RESTful API.
* Week 6: Social media sharing and Facebook comments.

### 5. Models

First of all, we will [extend](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/auth/customizing/#extending-the-existing-user-model) the existing `User` model using a one-to-one link:

`UserProfile`
* `role`
* `user = models.OneToOneField(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)`

`Game`
* `title`
* `image`
* `description`
* `price`
* `url`
* `developer = models.ForeignKey(UserProfile, on_delete=models.CASCADE)`
* `categories = models.ManyToManyField(Category, on_delete=models.CASCADE)`

`Purchase`
* `user = models.ForeignKey(UserProfile, on_delete=models.CASCADE)`
* `game = models.ForeignKey(Game, on_delete=models.CASCADE)`
* `timestamp`

`Result`
* `user = models.ForeignKey(UserProfile, on_delete=models.CASCADE)`
* `game = models.ForeignKey(Game, on_delete=models.CASCADE)`
* `score`
* `timestamp`

`Category`
* `title`

### 6. Layout Sketch

We used [Marvel](https://marvelapp.com) to build a simple clickable prototype; it can be found [HERE](https://marvelapp.com/405c5bh) ðŸ‘ˆ
